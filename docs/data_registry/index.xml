Main entities # The main entities represented in the schema are around the data and the software for epidemiological models:
DataProduct: A dataset that is used by or is generated by a model. ExternalObject: An external data object, i.e. one that has comes from somewhere other than being generated as part of the modelling pipeline.</description></item><item><title>Provenance Report</title><link>https://www.fairdatapipeline.org/docs/data_registry/prov_report/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.fairdatapipeline.org/docs/data_registry/prov_report/</guid><description>Provenance Report # In order to address the use case around being able to track the evidence to understand the reported results, the data registry has the capability to produce provenance reports for each of the data products.
Provenance is the documented history of processes in a digital object&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle.
The provenance reports generated by the registry are based around the concepts of activities, agents and entities. For more information about these concepts see the PROV Ontology or PROV-O.</description></item><item><title>RO Crate Objects</title><link>https://www.fairdatapipeline.org/docs/data_registry/ro_crate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.fairdatapipeline.org/docs/data_registry/ro_crate/</guid><description> Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) #</description></item></channel></rss>
